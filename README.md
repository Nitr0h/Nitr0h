# Yo, what's up. 👋🏿
My name's **Nitr0h**, and I'm a 14-year-old kid who wishes to become a Software & Game Developer. 

## What do you do right now? 🤨
Well, right now I develop games in **Rec Room**, [which you can check out here.](https://rec.net/user/Nitr0h/rooms) I also make YouTube videos around Rec Room where I upload Devlogs, Funny Moments, or Tech Challenges, [which you can also check out here.](https://youtube.com/Nitr0h)

## What do you WANT to do? 🤨
On top of what I mentioned above (a Software & Game Developer), I also want to build a complete personal website, make some mobile apps, _...and some other shit I'll find out sooner or later. I'll figure it out._
